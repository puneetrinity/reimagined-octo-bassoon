  - Adaptive chunk sizing based on routing confidence
  - Performance-aware streaming delays
  - Integration with routing arm performance metrics

- **Enhanced Cache Manager** (`app/optimization/enhanced_cache.py`)
  - Multi-layer (L1/L2) caching system
  - Adaptive TTL based on cache performance
  - Performance tracking and optimization

### 3. Integration Complete
- **Chat API Enhancement**: Integrated optimization modules into `app/api/chat.py`
- **Streaming Optimization**: Replaced static streaming with intelligent adaptive streaming
- **Cache Enhancement**: Upgraded cache usage to use enhanced multi-layer caching
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added routing confidence and arm performance tracking

### 4. Testing & Verification
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: All tests passing (test_adaptive_system.py)
- **Component Verification**: All 9 adaptive system components operational
- **Performance Verification**: Optimization verification test added and passing
- **Git Integration**: All changes committed and pushed to repository

## ðŸ“Š Performance Improvements

### Before Phase 1
- Static streaming with fixed chunk sizes
- Single-layer caching
- Basic async operations
- Limited performance monitoring

### After Phase 1
- **Intelligent Streaming**: Adaptive chunk sizes (4-20 words) based on performance
- **Enhanced Caching**: L1/L2 caching with adaptive TTL (30-300 seconds)
- **Optimized Async**: Non-blocking operations with proper error handling
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring and adaptive optimization
