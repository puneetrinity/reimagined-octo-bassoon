# RunPod Terminal Access Fix

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Container Process Management Issue**
- Current setup runs `supervisord` in daemon mode (`-c` flag) 
- Main script exits after starting supervisor
- Container loses its main process, causing RunPod terminal to freeze

### 2. **PID 1 Problem**
- Dockerfile CMD: `["/bin/bash", "-c", "/app/scripts/runpod-startup.sh"]`
- PID 1 = temporary bash process
- When startup script ends, container can exit unexpectedly

## Solutions Provided

### Option 1: Supervisord as PID 1 (Recommended)
**File:** `scripts/runpod-fixed-entrypoint.sh`
**Dockerfile:** `Dockerfile.runpod.fixed`

```bash
# Replaces bash process with supervisord using exec
exec /usr/bin/supervisord -n -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
```

**Benefits:**
- Supervisord becomes PID 1 and stays alive
- Proper signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- Most reliable for RunPod containers
- Services auto-restart on failure

### Option 2: Terminal-Friendly Background Services  
**File:** `scripts/runpod-terminal-keeper.sh`

```bash
# Starts supervisor in background, keeps foreground process alive
/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
while true; do sleep 30; done  # Keep main process alive
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains interactive terminal access
- Services run in background
- Main process stays alive to preserve terminal
- Includes health monitoring loop

## How to Apply the Fix

### Quick Fix (Current Container)
If your container is already running:

```bash
# Stop current broken startup
pkill -f runpod-startup.sh

# Use the terminal-keeper approach
/app/scripts/runpod-terminal-keeper.sh
```

### Rebuild with Fixed Dockerfile
For new deployments:

```bash
# Use the fixed Dockerfile
cp Dockerfile.runpod.fixed Dockerfile.runpod

# Rebuild image
docker build -f Dockerfile.runpod -t your-image:fixed .

# Deploy to RunPod with fixed image
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Problem Flow:
1. RunPod starts: `bash -c runpod-startup.sh` (PID 1)
2. Script runs: `supervisord -c config` (daemon mode, backgrounds immediately)  
3. Script continues: `exec /bin/bash` (tries to replace PID 1)
4. Race condition: supervisord may not be fully started
5. Container loses main process → RunPod terminal freezes

### Fixed Flow (Option 1):
1. RunPod starts: `runpod-fixed-entrypoint.sh` (PID 1)
2. Script prepares environment
3. Script replaces itself: `exec supervisord -n` (supervisord becomes PID 1)
4. Supervisord runs in foreground, managing all services
5. Container stays alive, RunPod terminal accessible via logs/exec

### Fixed Flow (Option 2):
1. RunPod starts: `runpod-terminal-keeper.sh` (PID 1) 
2. Script starts: `supervisord` in background
3. Script continues: infinite loop with `sleep 30`
4. Main process never exits → RunPod terminal stays accessible
5. Background services managed by supervisord

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check what's running as PID 1
ps aux | head -2

# Verify supervisord is running  
ps aux | grep supervisord

# Check if services are up
supervisorctl status

# Test API accessibility
curl localhost:8000/health

# Check RunPod specific URL
curl https://l4vja98so6wvh9-8000.proxy.runpod.net/health
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use Option 1** (`runpod-fixed-entrypoint.sh`) for production RunPod deployments
2. **Use Option 2** (`runpod-terminal-keeper.sh`) if you need frequent terminal access for debugging
3. Always test the fixed image locally with `docker run -it` before deploying to RunPod
4. Monitor container logs during deployment to ensure services start correctly
