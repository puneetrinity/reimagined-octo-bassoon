# Project Status

## Current State
- Core API endpoints (chat, search, health) are implemented and tested.
- Integration and system tests exist for both mocked and real backends.
- Ollama is set up as the LLM backend, with small models (e.g., tinyllama) available for low-memory systems.
- Model selection and loading is automatic, based on task type and quality requirements.
- Logging and debug tracing are in place for all major components.
- CI/CD integration is in progress.

## What Works
- Mocked integration tests pass reliably.
- Real integration tests pass if all dependencies (models, Redis, API keys) are available and configured.
- ModelManager handles model lifecycle and quality-based selection.

## What Needs Attention
- Ensure at least one model is always loaded (e.g., tinyllama for low-memory systems).
- Redis and all required API keys must be available for full functionality.
- Real integration tests should be run after any config or model changes.
- Documentation should be kept up to date as the system evolves.

## Next Steps
1. Verify and document all environment variables and model assignments.
2. Ensure onboarding and setup docs are clear for new developers.
3. Monitor logs and test results after any deployment or config change.
4. Continue to improve test coverage and performance.
