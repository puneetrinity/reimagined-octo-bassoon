**üéØ Ready to Begin Implementation**

This roadmap provides a clear path from your current state to a production-ready AI search system. Each phase builds logically on the previous one, with clear success criteria and risk mitigation strategies.

The key is maintaining discipline around the phased approach - resist the temptation to jump ahead to advanced features before the foundation is solid. Your architecture is excellent; now it's about methodical, high-quality implementation.

Let's start with Week 1, Day 1: OllamaClient implementation. Ready to begin?
